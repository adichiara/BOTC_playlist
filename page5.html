<p class="c3"><span>Leonard Cohen’s “Everybody Knows” is the anthem of grim resignation—and in </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span>, sometimes that’s exactly the mood. This song doesn’t plead or argue; it just shrugs and tells you the truth: “Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.” And you </span><span class="c2">believe</span><span class="c1"> it.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">It’s a perfect fit for the world of manipulated perceptions and whispered half-truths that defines the game. “Everybody knows that the good guys lost” sounds like something the Spy might say with a smirk—or the Undertaker, realizing too late they’ve been misled.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The lyrics drip with irony and cynicism: “Everybody knows the deal is rotten.” In Clocktower, that’s a fact of life—alliances crumble, players lie through their teeth, and just because someone is smiling doesn’t mean they’re not holding the knife.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Cohen’s low, deliberate delivery gives the song a slow burn of dread, matching the creeping paranoia of a long game where no one’s quite sure who to trust. It’s not flashy, but it’s undeniable. This track doesn’t just suit the game’s themes—it </span><span class="c2">inhabits</span><span class="c1"> them.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.jx92ut7c2zmo"><span class="c7">#4 – "The Man Comes Around" by Johnny Cash</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/3Jq9rsqmRtqcVKtzP9dnxZ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593885791&amp;usg=AOvVaw2yszke-FvjF69C6dUiLJaD">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 96.55%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“There’s a man going ‘round taking names…” Johnny Cash doesn’t ease you in—he tells you flat-out that reckoning is on its way. In </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">, that reckoning might be the final execution, the last desperate vote, or the evil team’s slow tightening of the noose. Either way, this track feels like prophecy.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>With biblical overtones and apocalyptic imagery, “The Man Comes Around” adds weight to every decision. Lines like “And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree” and “The hairs on your arm will stand up” don’t just evoke a mood—they </span><span class="c2">feel</span><span class="c1"> like the moment a player’s identity is revealed and the room goes dead silent.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">This isn’t just about theme. It’s about tone. Cash’s gravelly voice carries the gravity of truth, judgment, and fatal mistakes—fitting for a game where players sit in silence, trying to divine lies from honesty while the clock runs out.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The song’s pacing, shifting between spoken word and dark melody, mimics the rhythm of a session—tense, mysterious, and heavy with consequence. In the end, “The Man Comes Around” isn’t just a great match. It’s the sound of the game’s heartbeat at midnight.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.srqbc5ts6jfb"><span class="c7">#3 – "Gimme Shelter" by The Rolling Stones</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/6H3kDe7CGoWYBabAeVWGiD&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593888582&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ewiiIZd618WtDOVav3tzC">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 97.41%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“War, children… it’s just a shot away.” With that line alone, </span><span class="c2">Gimme Shelter</span><span> earns its place near the top of this countdown. The Rolling Stones crafted a song that pulses with dread, urgency, and impending disaster—all of which are cornerstones of </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The game thrives on that sense of encroaching threat. A wrong vote, a bad read, one more night phase—everything can turn. “Storm is threat’ning my very life today” is the voice of a Villager on the verge of being executed, or a Demon realizing the good team is closing in.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">There’s something primal in the song’s tempo: a slow, menacing build toward chaos. It mimics the feeling of a game tipping from suspicion into outright panic. Even Merry Clayton’s chilling vocals—raw and almost pleading—parallel those pivotal game moments when accusations fly and no one feels safe.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>What makes “Gimme Shelter” such a brilliant inclusion isn’t just its mood, though. It’s the way it frames conflict as both inevitable and intimate. Shelter isn’t just about protection—it’s about connection. And in </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">, choosing who to trust feels like life or death.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.bsue0yq5uoe5"><span class="c7">#2 – "Heathens" by Twenty One Pilots</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/6i0V12jOa3mr6uu4WYhUBr&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593891238&amp;usg=AOvVaw1R1jE2WkU2gUEMWXBnQDkA">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 98.28%</span></p>
<a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/6i0V12jOa3mr6uu4WYhUBr&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593891238&amp;usg=AOvVaw1R1jE2WkU2gUEMWXBnQDkA">Listen on Spotify<br/></a>
<p class="c3"><span>“Just because we check the guns at the door / Doesn’t mean our brains will change from hand grenades.” That lyric alone could’ve written itself into </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">. “Heathens” isn’t just a good fit—it’s practically a mood board for the game’s entire premise.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Twenty One Pilots crafts a brooding, claustrophobic atmosphere, one where danger is always present but hidden behind calm faces. “You’ll never know the psychopath sitting next to you” is basically a mission statement for every game night—where that sweet, smiling neighbor might just be the Demon.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The slow, deliberate pacing of the track mirrors how tension builds at the Clocktower table. No need for chaos right away. Instead, suspicion seeps in. Paranoia spreads. And everyone looks around the circle just a little longer.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>What sets this song apart is how personal it feels. “You don’t know the half of the abuse” cuts to the heart of </span><span class="c2">Clocktower</span><span class="c1">’s emotional stakes. You’re not just playing roles—you’re managing trust, doubt, fear. And “Heathens” plays that note with precision.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">With a near-perfect win rate and lyrics that sound like they were written for a secret meeting of Minions, this track doesn’t just make sense—it earns its place in the final stretch.</span></p>
