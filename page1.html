<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/0uukw2CgEIApv4IWAjXrBC&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593819205&amp;usg=AOvVaw0XtOx_7D1o1U5pz36gO8Ou">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 75.0%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>"Have you heard the news that you're dead?" My Chemical Romance doesn’t just open with a punch—it throws you straight into the chaos. “Dead!” plays like a twisted funeral march for the recently executed, channeling the same macabre humor and urgent drama that make </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1"> such a delicious mess of suspicion and spectacle.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lyrically, the track is biting: “If life ain't just a joke, then why are we laughing?” echoes the absurdity of bluffing your way to safety when death is a near certainty. Lines like “Did you get what you deserve?” land especially hard in a game where public executions are often fueled by gut instinct and bad reads. It’s theatrical, unhinged, and completely self-aware—just like the best moments in the game, where strategy collides with spectacle and nobody is ever quite innocent.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>It might not be the most subtle or universally beloved pick, but its over-the-top tone and death-obsessed lyrics make it a clever and pointed choice for kicking off this list. After all, in </span><span class="c2">Clocktower</span><span class="c1">, no one stays dead for long—and sometimes, the ghost has the best lines.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.ktq3aom235ta"><span class="c7">#24 – "The Perfume of Decay" by Tigercub</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/4wok4EEgQEi4JxQOmY35Dk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593821713&amp;usg=AOvVaw1S1Unmn31dryG3EnOg8LIl">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 78.45%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>Decay isn’t always loud—sometimes it seeps in slowly, like suspicion tightening its grip on a once-trusted ally. Tigercub’s “The Perfume of Decay” is drenched in atmosphere, and its brooding tone mirrors the slow unraveling of trust that defines </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1"> at its most psychological.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The title alone evokes the subtle stench of something gone wrong, and lyrics like “It’s the perfume of decay / It follows you around” could easily be spoken by a player nursing a creeping doubt about their neighbor. There’s a quiet inevitability to the track—an ambient dread—that feels perfectly at home in a game where alliances rot from within and nothing is ever quite as it seems.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Musically, it’s a contrast to more bombastic picks on this list, but that restraint is exactly what makes it work. This isn’t the sound of chaos—it’s the soundtrack to realization. The moment you start to suspect someone. The moment you realize you were wrong.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Placed here at #24, it might not scream for attention, but its thematic precision and chilling resonance with the game’s slow-burn tension make it an inspired choice. Some betrayals don’t need shouting. They just need time.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.oif2adllpdrz"><span class="c7">#23 – "Sabotage" by Beastie Boys</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/0Puj4YlTm6xNzDDADXHMI9&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593824784&amp;usg=AOvVaw1r-Ph5RvGaNqft3U0ZhHwR">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 79.31%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c1">There’s nothing subtle about being betrayed—and there’s nothing subtle about “Sabotage.” From the first screech of distortion, the Beastie Boys deliver a raw, chaotic anthem that perfectly matches the adrenaline surge of discovering that someone at the table is not who they say they are.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The line “I can’t stand it, I know you planned it” feels ripped straight from the mouth of a frustrated villager, catching on to a bluff just one beat too late. It’s the sound of an accusation mid-sentence, of pieces clicking together in real time. The vocals are urgent, shouted like a town meeting spiraling out of control. And isn’t that what most game nights become by the end?</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">“Sabotage” thrives on emotional energy. It doesn’t try to be clever—it charges headlong into the mess, just like a player who’s done being cautious and is ready to call out the demon hiding in plain sight. It’s accusatory. Unhinged. Unapologetic.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">That honesty earns it its place in the top 25. At #23, this track might be the least sneaky song on the list—but for a game that thrives on lies, sometimes it’s the scream that breaks the silence that hits hardest.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.e7qzmt1nw0ay"><span class="c7">#22 – "Should I Stay or Should I Go" by The Clash</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/39shmbIHICJ2Wxnk1fPSdz&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593827272&amp;usg=AOvVaw0P2nwobpYnmLTGzRStQZpj">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 79.31%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>Indecision is its own kind of betrayal in </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">. Every hesitation, every delayed vote, every glance across the table—these moments hold weight. That’s exactly what The Clash taps into with “Should I Stay or Should I Go.”</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The lyric “If I go there will be trouble, and if I stay it will be double” could practically be written on the grimoire. It’s the Villager’s dilemma: trust a hunch and risk exile, or stay quiet and let evil gain ground. There’s no safe move—only consequences, and the tension builds with every round.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The song’s stripped-down punk riff gives it a kind of raw simplicity that cuts through the noise, mirroring the game’s constant push and pull. It’s not about flashy powers or elaborate strategies—it’s about instinct. About the emotional math of suspicion. And when The Clash repeats the title line over and over, it mirrors that mental loop every player knows too well: “Do I say it now? Or wait just one more beat?”</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">At #22, this pick might seem casual—but don’t be fooled. It’s one of the most thematically dead-on tracks in the list. A perfect match for those moments in Clocktower where the clock ticks, everyone’s watching, and all eyes are on you.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.x5w0oj9vhz6c"><span class="c7">#21 – "Lunatic Fringe" by Red Rider</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/4rAnSE0E0f33unxXsQa5Fr&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593829969&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_hTovF-tba78CIiOip3RS">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 79.31%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c1">"Lunatic Fringe" isn't just a song title—it’s a role call for the Blood on the Clocktower table.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>The track’s moody synths and slow-building tension feel tailor-made for a night in Ravenswood Bluff. From the opening notes, there’s a sense of creeping dread, and the lyrics pull you deeper: </span><span class="c2">“We can hear you coming / We know what you’re after.”</span><span class="c1"> That could be the Townsfolk sniffing out the Demon—or the Outsiders realizing they’ve just been turned into scapegoats.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Lines like </span><span class="c2">“We’re on guard this time”</span><span> and </span><span class="c2">“Open season”</span><span class="c1"> reflect the heart of the game: suspicion turned to strategy, players banding together under threat, hoping their instincts are right. It’s not about loud chaos—it’s about the pressure that builds in silence, in side-eye glances and subtle nods.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">There’s no flashiness here, no theatrics—just the cold, watchful energy of a group that knows someone’s lying and refuses to blink first. “Lunatic Fringe” earns its place in the countdown by tapping into the paranoia, awareness, and collective tension that makes Blood on the Clocktower tick. It’s the soundtrack for those long, charged moments before the vote—when the room goes still and everyone leans just a little closer.</span></p>
