<h3 class="c4" id="h.8g4bnrcxzqqb"><span class="c7">#1 – "Sympathy for the Devil" by The Rolling Stones</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/1Ud6moTC0KyXMq1Oxfien0&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593894243&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YY_8vDtCh1hRBOxf-m_by">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 100.0%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“Pleased to meet you / Hope you guess my name.” If </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span> had a theme song, this might be it. There’s no hiding the relevance here—this track </span><span class="c2">is</span><span class="c1"> the game. With a charismatic narrator who revels in chaos, false charm, and centuries of mischief, "Sympathy for the Devil" doesn’t just hint at deceit—it luxuriates in it.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The song introduces its speaker as a charming figure who’s been pulling strings behind the scenes throughout history. “I’ve been around for a long, long year / Stole many a man’s soul and faith”—this could just as easily be the Demon on night one, smiling from the shadows. Or the devilish Minion who gently nudges suspicion in the wrong direction.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">What elevates this song is its gleeful embrace of duplicity. There's no shame here, just cunning and confidence—traits that any good Clocktower antagonist must master. The line “Just as every cop is a criminal / And all the sinners saints” plays right into the reversal of roles, the blurred lines, the masked intentions that define every session of the game.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>With a flawless 100% win rate, this isn't just the top-scoring song—it’s a crowning embodiment of what makes </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1"> so captivating: the charm of darkness, the thrill of pretending, and the power of perception. This is the Devil you suspect—and admire.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.xm92q51z5irt"><span class="c7">That’s All, Folks... Or Is It?</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span>And there you have it—the full countdown of 25 songs, each one clawing its way to the top of this </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1"> playlist with a mix of menace, melody, and metaphorical murder.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Let’s be clear: the songs were lovingly (and sometimes questionably) submitted by a group of </span><span class="c2">very opinionated</span><span class="c1"> players, each with their own interpretations of the game’s themes. But the rankings? Those were left to an AI with a penchant for lyrical analysis, statistical precision, and zero regard for your personal nostalgia. Think of it as your resident Savant—except it actually gave an answer.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>Now, if you’re staring at the list thinking, </span><span class="c2">Wait, why is my favorite song so low?</span><span> or </span><span class="c2">That one doesn’t even make sense!</span><span>—congratulations, you’ve just unlocked the true experience of </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">: feeling absolutely sure you’re right, and still getting voted out.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Is it perfect? No. But neither is your voting strategy.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">So cue up the playlist, pour yourself something suspicious, and let these songs soundtrack your next session of lies, loyalty, and last-minute accusations. And hey—if you still think a few tracks got robbed, just remember: even in the game, the truth doesn’t always win.</span></p>
