<h3 class="c4" id="h.lgr3u0tl5fkn"><span class="c7">#10 – "All Along the Watchtower" by Jimi Hendrix</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/2aoo2jlRnM3A0NyLQqMN2f&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593869953&amp;usg=AOvVaw2BI-a5lih9Loho_yghb9p4">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 88.79%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“There must be some kind of way out of here…” Few opening lines better capture the tension of </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">. Hendrix’s searing cover of Bob Dylan’s classic paints a cryptic, paranoid world of watchmen and wanderers, where danger is felt but rarely named—eerily reminiscent of a game night where truth is elusive and motives are masked.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The lyrics describe a landscape filled with jokers and thieves, mirroring the Clocktower table, where each role hides behind a smile or a bluff. “Businessmen, they drink my wine / plowmen dig my earth” might not be about villagers and demons, but it’s hard not to hear it that way once you’ve played. Everyone takes their fill—of trust, of time, of talk—before the storm arrives.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>And the storm </span><span class="c2">does</span><span class="c1"> arrive. “Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl”—the endgame, when accusations fly and the circle tightens. There’s no safety, only reckoning.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">With its swirling tension and layered symbolism, “All Along the Watchtower” is a natural thematic fit. It’s not just the mood, or the mystery—it’s the feeling that someone’s always watching, and no one’s ever quite safe.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.e3nfw4ei5msv"><span class="c7">#9 – "Psycho Killer" by Talking Heads</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/1i6N76fftMZhijOzFQ5ZtL&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593872645&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OU_UKQgBDeC9UD8x_89Sl">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 89.66%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“I can't seem to face up to the facts.” It’s the kind of line that feels plucked straight from a panicked villager in </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">, trying to keep their cool while paranoia swells. “Psycho Killer” taps into the game’s core dread: the quiet suspicion that someone sitting across from you—smiling, nodding—is anything but safe.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">David Byrne’s anxious delivery and twitchy rhythm reflect the mental strain of the game. When he sings, “I'm tense and nervous and I can't relax,” every Clocktower player knows that feeling. The fear of being caught in a lie—or worse, being wrong about someone else—echoes through every verse.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">And then the refrain: “Run, run, run, run, run, run, run away…” It's not just about fleeing; it’s about the impulse to hide, to deflect, to dodge the vote. Whether you're the Demon buying one more day or the Townsfolk fleeing suspicion, the track nails that pulse-pounding urgency.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">With its off-kilter charm, creeping menace, and uncanny psychological insight, “Psycho Killer” isn’t just a clever pick—it’s a dead-on match for the game’s most unhinged moments.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.46cvwcjbj74d"><span class="c7">#8 – "The Sharpest Lives" by My Chemical Romance</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/2kMjk14RmYyYhhSbipoa9U&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593875251&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Syap-uU6R-u5oHqgfDUT3">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 92.24%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>“The sharpest lives are the deadliest to lead.” That lyric alone could be a tagline for </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">. My Chemical Romance delivers a chaotic burst of energy and fatalistic swagger in “The Sharpest Lives,” capturing what it feels like to play with fire in a game of manipulation and mistrust.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">There’s blood on the hands, masks on the faces, and secrets in the dark. Lines like “Give me a shot to remember, and you can take all the pain away from me” evoke the tension between confession and control—do you speak up and risk everything, or stay quiet and hope your act holds?</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The song moves like the game does: fast, dramatic, and tinged with danger. When Gerard Way sings, “drop the dagger and lather the blood on your hands,” it's practically a ritual chant for a final day accusation. Theatrical, violent, seductive—it’s a Demon’s anthem and a warning to those who think they can dance with devils and walk away clean.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>With one of the highest win rates in the list, this track doesn’t just match the tone of </span><span class="c2">Clocktower</span><span class="c1">—it thrives in it. A perfect storm of adrenaline and artifice.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.s53ispwf88w7"><span class="c7">#7 – "People Are Strange" by The Doors</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/1Jmqubf9kGkWeYQXQKImL5&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593877843&amp;usg=AOvVaw053jZakBpUPO3r-4rQjm4L">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 93.97%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>"People are strange when you're a stranger." It's hard to think of a lyric more on-the-nose for </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span class="c1">. This eerie classic from The Doors sets the mood for a game built on mistrust and hidden motives.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">The song is soaked in disorientation—its slow, off-kilter rhythm mirrors the creeping uncertainty players feel when glances turn cold and no one can be trusted. “Faces look ugly when you're alone” resonates deeply when your alliances collapse and paranoia takes hold. It’s the soundtrack for those moments when someone you once trusted suddenly feels like a complete stranger—and maybe a killer.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Jim Morrison’s haunting voice floats above the minimalist instrumentation like a ghost in the tavern, watching silently as the group begins to fracture. Every word seems designed to underscore the social alienation that bleeds into gameplay when roles are hidden and intentions shift with the wind.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>It’s a perfect thematic match—clever without being obscure, unsettling without being over-the-top. The fact that it landed such a high win percentage shows that players weren’t just thinking about energy—they were thinking about atmosphere. And "People Are Strange" </span><span class="c2">is</span><span class="c1"> atmosphere.</span></p>
<h3 class="c4" id="h.im55fn5kaqf8"><span class="c7">#6 – "Time is Running Out" by Muse</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><span class="c5"><a class="c8" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://open.spotify.com/track/0EdMqiKs9LKXhspeQhl4RZ&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1748149593880458&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uy8jDsmsoielBMGA0UIXe">Listen on Spotify<br/></a></span><span> </span><span class="c0">Win Rate: 94.83%</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span>Few songs capture the ticking-clock tension of </span><span class="c2">Blood on the Clocktower</span><span> like Muse’s “Time is Running Out.” With its pulsing bassline and escalating urgency, this track practically </span><span class="c2">feels</span><span class="c1"> like the final moments of a game round—when the room falls quiet, eyes dart, and someone’s about to die.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">Lyrics like “You will suck the life out of me” reflect the high emotional stakes and psychological weight that come with betrayal. And the chilling declaration “Our time is running out” could easily be the rallying cry of a town teetering on collapse, struggling to uncover the Demon before it's too late.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">What sets this pick apart is how well the song balances tension with control. The restrained verses build pressure like a coiled spring, then explode into soaring choruses—just like those sudden shifts in gameplay when someone drops a bombshell claim or reveals a powerful role.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span>It’s not just a thematic fit; it </span><span class="c2">sounds</span><span class="c1"> like Clocktower feels. No surprise this one landed so high—this is the sound of urgency, suspicion, and unraveling nerves.</span></p>
